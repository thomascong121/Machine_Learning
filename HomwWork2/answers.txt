*** Question 1(b) [1 mark]
--- In sklearn's decision tree learning implementation, the parameter
--- "min_samples_leaf" places a lower bound on the number of training
--- set examples that can appear at any leaf of the decision tree. This
--- data is used during learning to assign a decision to that leaf,
--- e.g., by assigning the leaf to predict the majority class of the
--- training set examples at the leaf. By increasing the value of the
--- "min_samples_leaf" parameter we can expect this to:

--- (1) decrease overfitting by decreasing the number of examples at any leaf
(2) decrease overfitting by increasing the number of examples at any leaf
--- (3) increase overfitting by decreasing the number of examples at any leaf
--- (4) increase overfitting by increasing the number of examples at any leaf

*** Question 1(c) [1 mark]
--- We can ask the question: for datasets with medium levels of added
--- noise, has the search to set the value of the "min_samples_leaf"
--- parameter resulted in improved test set accuracy compared to the
--- default parameter settings ?  Looking at the table, we conclude the
--- answer is:

--- (1) no
--- (2) yes, for 1/4 of the datasets
--- (3) yes, for 2/4 of the datasets
(4) yes, for 3/4 of the datasets
--- (5) yes, for 4/4 of the datasets

*** QUESTION 2  [Total: 7 marks]

--- For this question you must copy and paste below the code you wrote to
--- complete the implementation of the RNN. Be sure not to introduce
--- any changes from your final code as it ran in the notebook !!!

--- setup for the current step  [2 marks]
layer_input=numpy.concatenate((outputs.pop(), X[:, step, :]), axis=1)
weight = self.weights[1][:64,:] if step==self.input_size - 1 else self.weights[0][:64,:]

--- calculate gradients  [1 mark]
gradients, dW, db=self.derivatives_of_hidden_layer(previous_gradients,layer_output,layer_input,weight)

--- update weights  [2 marks]
self.weights[0] += self.learning_rate / X.shape[0] * dW
self.biases[0] += self.learning_rate / X.shape[0] * db

--- setup for the next step  [2 marks]
previous_gradients = gradients
layer_output = layer_input[:,:64]

*** END
