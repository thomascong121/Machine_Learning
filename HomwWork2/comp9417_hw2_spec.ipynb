    "## Question 1 â€“ Overfitting avoidance [Total: 3 marks]\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with noisy data is a key issue in machine learning. Unfortunately, even algorithms that have noise-handling mechanisms built-in, like decision trees, can overfit noisy data, unless their \"overfitting avoidance\" or *regularization* hyper-parameters are set properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using datasets that have had various amounts of \"class noise\" added\n",
    "by randomly changing the actual class value to a different one for a\n",
    "specified percentage of the training data.\n",
    "Here we will specify three arbitrarily chosen levels of noise: low\n",
    "($20\\%$), medium ($50\\%$) and high ($80\\%$).\n",
    "The learning algorithm must try to \"see through\" this noise and learn\n",
    "the best model it can, which is then evaluated on test data *without*\n",
    "added noise to evaluate how well it has avoided fitting the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also let the algorithm do a limited _grid search_ using cross-validation\n",
    "for the best *over-fitting avoidance* parameter settings on each training set.\n",

    "as your answer for \"Question 1(a)\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the code section is a table, which represents the percentage accuracy of classification for the decision tree algorithm. The first column contains the result of the \"Default\" classifier, which is the decision tree algorithm with default parameter settings running on each of the datasets which have had $50\\%$ noise added. From the second column on, in each column the results are obtained by running the decision tree algorithm on $0\\%$, $20\\%$, $50\\%$ and $80\\%$ noise added to each of the datasets, and in the parentheses is shown the result of a [grid search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) that has been applied to determine the best value for a basic parameter of the decision tree algorithm, namely [min_samples_leaf](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) i.e., the minimum number of examples that can be used to make a prediction in the tree, on that dataset. \n",

    "Answer these questions in the file called [*answers.txt*](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417/19T2/hw2/answers.txt). Your answers must be based on the results table you saved in \"Question 1(a)\".\n",
