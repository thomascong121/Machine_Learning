    "results, using your knowledge of machine learning.\n",

    "After completing this homework you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- set up replicated $k$-fold cross-validation experiments to obtain average\n",
    "  performance measures of algorithms on datasets\n",
    "- compare the performance of different algorithms against a base-line\n",

    "\n",
    "There are 2 questions in this homework. Each question has two parts: the Python code which must be run to generate the output results on the given datasets, and the responses you give in the file [*answers.txt*](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417/19T2/hw1/answers.txt) on your analysis and interpretation of the results  produced by running these learning algorithms for the question. Marks are given for both parts: submitting correct output from the code, and giving correct responses. For each question, you will need to save the output results from running the code to a separate plain text file. There will also be a plain text file containing the questions which you will need to edit to specify your answers. These files will form your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, your submission will comprise a total of 3 (three) files which should be named as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "q1.out\n",

    "answers.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please note: files in any format other than plain text **cannot be accepted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your files using ```give```. On a CSE Linux machine, type the following on the command-line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ give cs9417 hw1 q1.out q2.out answers.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can submit using the web-based interface to ```give```.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can download the datasets required for the homework [here](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417/hw1/datasets.zip).\n",
    "Note: you will need to ensure the dataset files are in the same directory from which you are started the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please Note**: this homework uses datasets in the Attribute-Relation File Format (.arff). To load datasets from '.arff' formatted files, you will need to have installed the ```liac-arff``` package. You can do this using ```pip``` at the command-line, as follows:\n",

    "For this question the objective is to run two different learning algorithms on a range of different sample sizes taken from the same training set to assess the effect of training sample size on error. You will use the nearest neighbour classifier and the decision tree classifier to generate two different sets of \"learning curves\" on 8 real-world datasets:\n",

    "### Running the classifiers  [2 marks]\n",
    "You will run the following code section, and save the results to a plain text file \"q1.out\". Note that this may take a little time to run, so be patient ! Code has been added to save the output for you. However, you will need to write your own code to compute the error reduction for question 1(b).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the code section comprises two tables, which represent the percentage error of classification for the nearest neighbour and the decision tree algorithm respectively. The first column contains the result of the baseline classifier, which simply predicts the majority class. From the second column on, the results are obtained by running the nearest neighbour or decision tree algorithms on $10\\%$, $25\\%$, $50\\%$, $75\\%$, and $100\\%$ of the data. The standard deviation are shown in brackets, and where an asterisk is present, it indicates that the result is significantly different from the baseline.\n",

    "Answer these questions in the file called [*answers.txt*](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417/19T2/hw1/answers.txt). Your answers must be based on the results you saved in \"q1.out\". **_Please note_**: the goal of these questions is to attempt to **_explain why_** you think the results you obtained are as they are.\n",

    "**1(a). [1 mark]** Refer to [*answers.txt*](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417/19T2/hw1/answers.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1(b). [4 marks]** For each algorithm over all of the datasets, find the average change in error when moving from the default prediction to learning from 10% of the training set as follows.\n",
    "Let the error on the base line be err<sub>0</sub> and the error on 10% of the training set be error<sub>10</sub>.\n",
    "For each algorithm, calculate the percentage reduction in error relative to the default on each dataset as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{err_0 - err_{10}}{err_{0}} \\times 100.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now repeat exactly the same process by comparing the two classifiers over all of the datasets, learning from $100\\%$ of the training set, compared to default. Organise your results by grouping them into a 2 by 2 table, something like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves mining text data, for which machine learning algorithms typically use a transformation into a dataset of \"word counts\". In the original dataset each text example is a string of words with a class label, and the sklearn transform converts this to a vector of word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains \"snippets\", short sequences of words taken from Google searches, each of which has been labelled with one of 8 classes, referred to as \"sections\", such as business, sports, etc. The dataset is provided already split into a training set of $10,060$ snippets and a test set of $2,280$ snippets (for convenience, the combined dataset is also provided as a separate file). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a vector representation for text data means that we can use many of the standard classifier learning methods. However, such datasets are typically  highly _sparse_, in the sense that for any example (i.e., piece of text) nearly all of its feature values are zero. To tackle this problem, we typically apply methods of feature selection (or dimensionality reduction). In this question you will investigate the effect of using the [SelectKBest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html) method to select the $K$ best features (words or tokens in this case) that appear to help classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the classifier  [1 mark]\n",
    "You will run the following code section, and save the results to a plain text file \"q2.out\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the code section is 5 lines of output, each of which represents the percentage accuaracy of classification on training and test set for different amounts of feature selection.\n",
    "The first such line representst the \"default\", i.e., using all features. The remaining 4 lines show the effect of learning and predicting on text data where only the top $K$ features are being used.\n",

    "Answer this question in the file called [*answers.txt*](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417/18s1/ass1/answers.txt). Your answers must be based on the results you saved in \"q2.out\".\n",
